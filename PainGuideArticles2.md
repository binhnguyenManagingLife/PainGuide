# Primary title: Pain After Surgery: What to Expect
  ## Secondary title: Learn more about different types of pain after surgery
  ### Content: When it comes to having surgery, it’s common to worry about having pain afterwards. This is especially true if you already have chronic pain. A good way to help with worrying is to learn more about what to expect.

There are different types of pain after surgery. Most people experience some pain during the recovery period after surgery. This pain is usually caused by the cut or incision to the part of the body that was operated on and the inflammation that helps the wound heal. It is normal to have pain after surgery. As the body heals, the pain goes down. This type of pain is called acute post-surgical pain[1] and normally lasts a few weeks though for some surgeries it can last longer and others shorter. By definition, acute post-surgical pain lasts up to 3 months. After that it is called chronic post-surgical pain.

Acute post-surgical pain can be treated with pain medication and medical procedures, like epidurals and nerve blocks[3]. 

Your doctor will usually prescribe pain medication to help manage acute pain as you recover. You might also do some physical rehabilitation to regain your strength and mobility. Movement and gentle exercise in the days and weeks after surgery can also help with your recovery even though in some cases it can increase managing pain temporarily. This is normal. If your pain is causing distress, it may also be helpful to speak with a psychologist.

For some people, pain after surgery may last more than 3 months. Pain that continues even though the body has healed from surgery is called chronic post-surgical pain[2].

Chronic post-surgical pain is not easily treated with medical approaches alone.

The best way to treat this type of pain is by combining medicine with physical rehabilitation and counselling. It’s important to speak to your doctor if your pain continues 3 months after surgery to discuss appropriate treatment options.

# Primary title: Preparing to Manage Pain After Surgery
  ## Secondary title: How to prepare to take charge of pain when it happens
  ### Content: It’s common to feel some pain after surgery. It’s a normal part of the healing process. The good news is that there are things you can do beforehand so that you’re ready to take control of your pain after surgery.

Knowing what to expect will help you manage anxiety and worry about pain.

Speak to your doctor and anesthesiologist about how much pain to expect after surgery and how it will be managed. Everyone’s pain is different, but your doctor will tell you what’s a typical amount of pain for your type of surgery. If your pain is worse than expected, you’ll know to talk to your doctor about it.

Your doctor will ask about the medications that you’re already taking. This is a good time to speak to your doctor about the pain medications that will be used during and after your surgery and the typical side effects. Knowing more about your medications will help to ease concerns about how your pain will be managed.

Even before your surgery, it’s helpful to plan for how you’ll manage your pain after you leave the hospital.

Speak to your doctor about your plan for managing pain at home. Ask about the types of things that you can do to manage pain alongside taking medication. For example, breathing and relaxation strategies can help calm down the nervous system and reduce pain. You can also ask your doctor about what type of movement is safe to do so you can regain your strength and get back to your daily activities. Remember, pain after surgery is normal and is to be expected. You will probably be encouraged by the nurses on the ward to start moving around in the days after surgery. This may also be painful but it is safe to do. Not all pain is bad.

After you leave the hospital, it’s important to keep track of the pain and not to try to tough it out. Keep up with your planned medication schedule. Managing pain before it gets too bad will help you to return to your daily activities and help your recovery. 
Having a plan in place for your pain and recovery will help you feel more in control and ease your worries. Reach out to your doctor if your pain is more intense or persists beyond what you expected.

# Primary title: Why Pain Can Persist After Surgery
  ## Secondary title: Sometimes pain after surgery continues even after the body has healed 
  ### Content: For most people, pain after surgery lasts for a relatively short period of time. As their body heals, the pain goes away. 

For some people, pain after surgery can last for quite some time. If it lasts longer than 3 months, it’s a sign that they might have a condition called chronic post-surgical pain[2].

Why does pain after surgery persist for some people? 

After surgery, parts of the brain that process pain become more sensitive to signals from the body. This is normal and happens any time there is damage to the body. A common example is what happens with a sunburn. If you gently scratch the skin after a sunburn, you feel more pain than you would normally.  

Once the body has healed after surgery, sensitivity in the body and brain returns to normal and the pain goes away. But for some people, things don’t return to normal. The brain is still more sensitive to signals from the body even though the body has now healed.

Increased sensitivity of the brain can change how things feel in the body. Things can hurt even when the body has recovered and there is no more harm to the body. 

Pain that persists for a long time after surgery is a condition in itself.

This type of chronic pain condition needs a different treatment approach than what is used for acute pain after surgery[1]. Clinical studies show that the best way to treat chronic post-surgical pain[2] is through a combination of approaches, including medication, rehabilitation, and counselling.

# Primary title: How to Reduce your Risk of Ongoing Pain After Surgery
  ## Secondary title: There are things you can do if you’re worried about having ongoing pain after surgery
  ### Content: The thought of pain persisting after surgery can be very stressful. This is especially true if you already have chronic pain[1] or worry a lot about pain. Here are a few things you can do to reduce the chances of it happening to you.

Talk to your doctor and anesthesiologist before surgery about your pain condition and concerns about pain. 

Your healthcare team will work to ensure that your pain is well-managed during and after surgery. Ask ahead about the supports that are available to help you manage your pain after surgery and when you leave the hospital. 

Ask your doctor about how much pain to expect with your type of surgery.

Surgeries that are more invasive or take a long time can increase the chances of pain persisting afterwards. The same thing can happen if there are any complications during surgery or you need more than one surgery. Speak to your doctor about how to adjust your pain management plan to your situation. Having a plan in place for your pain and recovery will help you feel more in control and ease your worries as you prepare for surgery.

If you have more pain than expected after surgery, it’s important to bring it up with your doctor. Proper pain management right after surgery is the key to reducing the chances of having chronic pain.

# Primary title: How do you know you’re ready for more?
  ## Secondary title: Understand your tolerance for expanding your goal
  ### Content: It can be challenging to know when you are ready to progress an activity or exercise as you pursue meaningful activities.
 
By reviewing your pain records in the Results section of the app, you may start to observe patterns that help you better understand what impacts your pain and flare ups.
 
Knowing these allows you to better assess your activity tolerance on a given day. The more you learn about what influences your pain patterns and flare ups, the more you will know when you are ready for more.
 
A valuable approach to assess your ability to do more, is to ask “Is my pain tolerable?”
 
Reflecting on your pain tolerance[1] can let you know how you are managing in the moment. It’s possible your symptoms may not change when pursuing a meaningful activity. If they do, when do you first notice the change? If it is a tolerable change, then continue. Could changing how you perform the task improve your tolerance? Does the change in symptoms require you to take a brief break?  Can you return to the activity after a break?  When does the change in symptoms become intolerable?
 
It’s helpful to view these trials as opportunities to learn more about what your system tolerates.
 
Learning this can help you plan for the next time you perform the meaningful activity. Try different strategies. How does it go when you perform a task in the morning versus the afternoon? Right after taking medication or an hour or two after? If you are experiencing more stress or are more relaxed? When other thoughts are distracting you? Understanding why it is easier to complete a task one day and harder another can help you be confident in knowing when you are ready for more.

# Primary title: Sleep and Pain
  ## Secondary title: 
  ### Content: It is common to focus on how much sleep someone does or does not get. It is important to know that the quality of sleep matters too. How rested you feel after sleep can help you know that your sleep was restorative for you.

There are five stages of sleep. They move through being awake, light sleep, deep sleep, and deeper sleep, until reaching a very active REM sleep[2] state. These stages are identified by their unique brain wave patterns, heart rate, breathing rate, and body temperature. Time spent in each of these stages changes throughout the night and can also change due to external factors.

 Sleep is important for quality of life and day to day activity.

Sleep has been linked to health and healing, including immune support and inflammation management. Sleep also supports memory, thinking, decision making, reaction time, and mood. These relationships work in both directions. Sleep challenges can impact health, and health can impact sleep. 
 
Improving sleep can help your pain

It is common for people who experience chronic pain to also have difficulty sleeping. This may be due to being more aware of and distracted by pain itself, thoughts about pain, having a hard time finding a comfortable position, taking medications that disrupt sleep, and not being able to move or exercise enough during the day because of pain. Disrupted sleep can have a big impact on descending pain modulation[1]. 

Even if you are in pain, there are steps that you can take steps to improve your sleep. You can set up your environment to be as comfortable as possible, manage thoughts that interfere with sleep, and develop a relaxing routine to help you fall and stay asleep. These strategies can help you find restorative sleep and manage your pain.

[1] Descending pain modulation: The ability of the brain to send nerve signals to the spinal cord that either enhance or reduce the intensity of pain.

[2] REM sleep: Rapid eye movement sleep is a unique phase of sleep characterized by random rapid movement of the eyes, accompanied by low muscle tone throughout the body, and the propensity of the sleeper to dream vividly.

# Primary title: Sleep Health-Self Assessment
  ## Secondary title: 
  ### Content: Frustration around poor sleep and not feeling rested is hard. It can be difficult to know where to begin to address sleep. It is helpful to start by better understanding your sleep patterns.

Looking at sleep efficiency can help you better focus your efforts.

Sleep efficiency[1] refers to how much time is spent sleeping, compared to how much time is spent in bed trying to sleep. Time in bed attempting to sleep includes how long it takes to fall asleep, how many wake ups occur, how long they last, and time spent trying to nap. Improving sleep efficiency is a good step toward better sleep health.

Once you’ve Identified how long it takes to fall asleep, how often and for how long you are awake during sleep time, and how much time is spent trying to fall back asleep, you can choose which of these to focus on first.

The next step is identifying what is occurring during these challenging sleep times. 

Are you having a hard time getting comfortable? Are you thinking about things you want to remember, worrying about something, or frustrated that you are not sleeping? Are you just not tired enough?  Is there too much light or noise? Do you share your bed with a partner who tosses and turns or snores loudly. Is it too hot or too cool in the room? 

Understanding your individual difficulties around sleep, creates opportunities to try different sleep strategies.

It is useful to write down your patterns and what you’ve learned about them. Talking through them with a healthcare provider or support person may help too.
