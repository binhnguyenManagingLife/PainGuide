# Primary title: Is Your Pain Acute or Chronic?
  ## Secondary title: How to tell when acute pain becomes chronic
  ### Content: Pain is a normal sensation in response to an actual or possible threat to the body. It’s a warning signal that protects the body from danger or harm. 

A new pain that is temporary and is caused by an injury, surgical procedure, or a specific health condition is called acute pain. This type of pain tells us that we need to rest and heal. Acute pain goes away as the body heals and usually lasts less than 3 months.

Some pain lasts longer than the time needed for the body to heal. When pain lasts longer than 3 months, it is called chronic pain. With chronic pain, even though the injury or damage has healed, the body continues to generate the warning signal that we feel as pain. 

Chronic pain can be caused by the pain warning signal becoming overactive in the body’s nervous system. Some health conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis may also lead to chronic pain. 
It is important to speak to your doctor if you think you have chronic pain. To help explain to your doctor how your pain feels, it is helpful to track your pain day to day.

# Primary title: Pain Changes Your Nervous System
  ## Secondary title: What is neuroplasticity and how can you harness it to cope with pain?
  ### Content: Our nervous system can adapt to the unique experiences of our lives, like having pain. Neuroplasticity is a term used to describe this changing nature of the nervous system. 

Unfortunately, neuroplasticity can also be responsible for chronic pain. This happens when the pain signals in the nervous system get stronger and get triggered more easily. It can happen even when the initial source of pain, like an injury or damage to the body, has healed.

The good news is that neuroplasticity can be used to help manage pain even after chronic pain has set in. 

You can harness neuroplasticity by using pain coping strategies that help the nervous system change and adapt in new ways. 

Over time, coping strategies can make permanent changes to the nervous system that put the pain signal in the background. The pain signal is not erased, but it can be drowned out by strengthening more positive signals in the nervous system.

# Primary title: Why Does Pain Have Different Characteristics?
  ## Secondary title: Find out about the different nerve fibers that carry pain signals.
  ### Content: Pain has many different characteristics. Some pain may feel like an intense sharp sensation that lasts for a short time. Other pain may feel like a throbbing dull ache that is long-lasting. Some pain feels like burning, electric shocks, pins and needles, and the list goes on. 

Why are there different characteristics of pain?

Nerve fibers carry pain signals from different parts of the body to the spine. There are several types of nerve fibers that differ in size and in how fast they transmit pain information. Nerve fibers called A-delta are thicker and carry information quickly. They have a coating of insulation called myelin that helps the electric signal travel faster. C fibers are thinner and send pain signals more slowly. For example, when you stub your toe, you first feel a sharp pain because of the fast action of A-delta fibers. Then the pain changes to a throbbing ache because of the slower-acting C fibers. 

Some characteristics of pain may indicate that the pain fibers are not working properly. When pain feels like burning, electric shocks, pins and needles, tingling, or shooting, this may be a sign of a neuropathic pain condition. The characteristics of your pain are important to keep track of. They can help your doctor better understand how your pain feels and why it might be happening.

  ### Defintions
Nerve fibers: Nerve fibers are the elongated parts of nerve cells that carry pain signals from one part of the body to another.

A-delta fibers: A-delta fibers are nerve fibers that carry pain signals from the periphery of the body to the spinal cord. A-delta fibers carry pain signals more quickly because they are covered with a myelin sheath that helps to increase the speed of transmission.

Myelin: Myelin is an insulating fatty sheath that surrounds nerve fibers and helps to increase the speed of the nerve signal.

C fibers: C fibers are nerve fibers that carry pain signals from the periphery of the body to the spinal cord. C fibers carry pain signals more slowly.

Neuropathic pain: Neuropathic pain is one type of pain that is caused by damage to nerves that transmit information about pain, touch, and temperature. 

# Primary title: Characteristics as Clues to Your Pain
  ## Secondary title: Why it helps to track the characteristics of your pain
  ### Content: Pain can be described by different words, like throbbing, dull, sharp, or burning. Some pain comes on suddenly and stops just as quickly, while other pain builds slowly and persists over a long period of time. 

The characteristics of your pain can provide clues to what is happening in your body. 

Different pain characteristics are linked to different conditions or injuries. For example, pain that feels like burning, electric shocks, or pins and needles may be a sign of a neuropathic pain condition. Keeping track of your pain characteristics can help your doctor better assess your condition.

# Primary title: Putting Pain into Words
  ## Secondary title: How to describe your pain during your next doctor’s visit
  ### Content: Many people struggle with describing pain to their doctor. It is often difficult to put the experience of pain into words. By keeping track of how your pain feels from day to day, it will be easier to notice patterns and explain what you feel to your doctor. 

Pain can be described by different characteristics, like aching, throbbing, dull, sharp, burning, or electric shocks. Some pain comes on suddenly, while other pain lasts over a long period of time. Pain can be located in a specific part of the body, but it can also be more widespread and hard to pinpoint to a particular body part. 

To help your doctor understand and treat your pain, it’s useful to pay attention to the different aspects of your pain. 

What are the characteristics of your pain, how intense it is, and where, when, and for how long do you feel pain? What you’re feeling can provide clues to what is happening in your body. These clues can help your doctor diagnose your condition and decide on the best treatment.

Manage My Pain can be used to keep a record of the words that best describe your pain and can help you feel more confident during your next doctor's visit.

# Primary title: Learn About Dull Pain
  ## Secondary title: What is dull pain and what causes it?
  ### Content: Dull pain usually refers to a deep discomfort that lasts over a long period of time. It has a low or moderate level of intensity. Dull pain is not located in a specific spot in the body, but rather it feels more spread out. 

Some examples of dull pain include a mild headache or a sore muscle. This type of pain usually does not stop you from doing your daily activities. It is more in the background as you go about your day. 

Dull pain is sometimes called slow pain. This pain signal is usually carried by slower nerve fibers. 

When you stub your toe, you first feel a sharp intense pain. The sharp pain is carried by fast A-delta nerve fibers. Then the pain spreads out within a few seconds and turns into dull pain. Dull pain is carried by slower C fibers. Dull pain can last for a while after an injury because of inflammation at the site of the injury.

Inflammation: Inflammation is an uncomfortable swelling of a body part that can be painful, red, and hot. Inflammation is a natural response of the body’s immune system to heal an injury or fight an infection.

# Primary title: Understand Throbbing Pain
  ## Secondary title: What is throbbing pain and what causes it?
  ### Content: Throbbing pain is best described as a repeated pulsating ache. Other words that describe throbbing pain include pulsing, pounding, or beating pain. Some examples of throbbing pain include a headache, a migraine, or a toothache.

For a long time, throbbing pain was thought to be linked to the rhythm of blood pulsing through blood vessels. Recent research shows that throbbing is also closely linked to brain wave activity. This research may help with the diagnosis and treatment of conditions like migraines.

# Primary title: Learn About Sharp Pain
  ## Secondary title: What is sharp pain and what causes it?
  ### Content: Sharp pain usually has a sudden onset in a specific location of the body that lasts for a short time. Other words to describe sharp pain include pricking, piercing, stabbing, shooting, or electric shocks.

An everyday example of sharp pain is the intense feeling when you first prick your finger, get a paper cut, or have a more serious injury like an ankle sprain. 

Sharp pain is often referred to as fast pain. 

Specialized nerves called A-delta fibers carry this pain signal quickly from the site of injury to the spinal cord where the signal is processed and sent upwards to the brain. 

In some chronic pain conditions sharp pain can occur without any injury or damage to the body.  In this case, the pain is produced by the nerve fibers because of damage or disease of the nerves themselves. Having sharp pain without any obvious injury to the body may be a sign of a neuropathic pain condition.

# Primary title: The Benefits of Gentle Movement
  ## Secondary title: How to develop a sense of safety to move through pain
  ### Content: It is normal to reduce movement and physical activity in response to pain. After an injury, rest is typically recommended to allow the body to heal. Yet, gradually increasing activity over time can help to improve pain. Make sure to consult with your doctor before starting a new type of activity or exercise.
 
Gentle movement, even if there is some pain, can actually help in the healing process. 

In the long term, physical activity can help in managing pain. It can also help to improve mood, sleep, and energy levels.
 
Avoiding physical activity teaches the brain that it’s not safe to move when there is pain. This is the “wait until” trap. It makes you delay and avoid doing activities that can actually help improve how you feel.
 
Rather than waiting until the pain goes down, try doing some gentle activity even if you feel some pain. You can start slow and pace yourself with daily gentle movement. You will find that you can gradually increase your activity over time. You can also adapt some of your favorite activities with assistive devices.
 
Over time, you will develop a sense of safety around pain and movement. 

You can use the helpful mantra “This hurts but doesn’t harm me” to get started with increasing your physical activity.

# Primary title: How to Exercise Safely
  ## Secondary title: Tips to help you get more active without risking a flare-up
  ### Content: Regular physical activity is a helpful coping strategy for managing pain. It can also help to improve your sleep, mood, and energy level.
 
Physical activity involves any type of body movement that requires the use of muscles and increased energy. Some recommended activities that can help with pain are walking, gentle yoga, tai chi, swimming, aquafit, or dancing.
 
Choosing the activity that’s right for you will depend on your health condition, fitness level, and preferences. But how do you know if you’re doing the right kind of activity that won’t lead to a flare-up or make pain worse?

Here are some tips to help you get more active safely:
 
1.   Make sure to consult with your doctor before starting a new type of activity or exercise.
2.   Start slowly with a familiar activity like taking a walk. Pace your progress and balance activity with rest.
3.   Find ways to adapt an activity to your needs. For example, if you’re doing gentle yoga you can use a chair for support.
4.   If you feel pain, ask yourself if this pain is in a new area of the body or has new characteristics (sharp, tingling, burning, etc.) or if it feels like your usual pain. If it feels like your usual pain, then it’s usually ok to gently continue with the movement. If it’s a new pain, then you can try changing something about the movement or the pace of the activity.
5.   You may have some muscle soreness after an activity that may last for about 2 or 3 days. Muscle soreness is normal when you first start exercising and will stop happening with repeated practice.  If the pain lasts longer than 2 or 3 days it's probably not muscle soreness. It may be a sign to change something about the activity or consider a different one.
6.   If pain increases with every repetition of a movement, you can make smaller movements, change the pace, or decrease the number of repetitions.
7.   Gradually introduce new movements or increase the duration of activity to train your body to feel safe with the activity.

  ### Defintions
Flare-up: The term flare-up refers to a sudden increase in the intensity of pain symptoms. 

# Primary title: Find Your Optimal Activity Level
  ## Secondary title: Improve your tolerance for regular physical activity to better cope with pain
  ### Content: Consult with your doctor about the type of activity that you can do safely and that will be beneficial for you. Your activity regiment should be tailored to your specific pain condition.

Keeping active is a helpful coping strategy for chronic pain. But when you live with pain, it can be hard to balance how much physical activity you do on a regular basis.
 
On a good day, you may push too hard to get things done and cause a flare-up of pain. Then you don’t do any activity as you wait for the pain to go down. This pattern can feel like a roller coaster that derails your plans for staying active and keeping pain at bay. It’s called the “boom or bust” cycle.

How can you find your optimal activity level?
 
Your tolerance for physical activity can be reduced by pain from too much or too little physical activity. To expand your tolerance for regular activity, it’s important to pace your activity level and avoid overdoing it when you feel well.
 
At the same time, it’s important to continue to do gentle activities even when you have pain. This will train your body to feel safe with movement even if the pain is there. Over time, your tolerance of physical activity will increase so that you can keep a regular routine.

# Primary title: Is Coping a Bad Word?
  ## Secondary title: The definition of coping actually means taking action.
  ### Content: Is coping[2] your least favourite word?

Coping may come up a lot when you talk to people about your chronic pain[1]. They may ask “How are you coping?” And some may even say: “You should cope better!” No wonder hearing this word can often be frustrating. You may feel like people expect you to just deal with the pain.

What does coping mean? The word coping comes from the French word coup which means a strike or blow. So, coping with pain actually means taking action to strike against pain!

Coping is more than just dealing with pain. Coping is about regaining your power and taking action.

We commonly use the term coping to refer to anything a person does to respond to something threatening, challenging, or stressful. Pain is a threat to the body. Coping with pain refers to all the different things that you think, feel, and do in response to pain to try to make it better. For example, when you think “This flare-up will pass with time,” that is a coping thought. When you use ice or heat to manage pain, that is a coping action.

When you cope with pain you’re taking action, whatever that may be. Some actions may be more helpful than others, depending on your situation. Learning about different ways of coping can help you find what works best for you.  

So next time you hear the word coping, let it be a reminder that your thoughts and actions can help you to regain your power over pain.

# Primary title: Different Ways of Coping
  ## Secondary title: Some ways of coping can be more beneficial than others
  ### Content: There is more to coping with pain than just “grinning and bearing” it. There are ways of coping that can actually help with pain. 

Research studies show that some actions that people take to cope with chronic pain help more than others. 

Actions that usually work well are called adaptive coping strategies. Some common examples include: practicing relaxation, engaging in physical activity, or saying affirming statements to yourself.

There are also actions to cope with chronic pain that often do harm in the long term. These are called maladaptive coping strategies. Some common examples include: avoiding physical activities for fear of making the pain worse or assuming that the worst will happen.

Even though some actions help more than others, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for coping with pain. 

Things that are harmful in some situations may be helpful in others. Most important is to evaluate for yourself if an action is helpful or harmful to how you manage your pain. You’ll know that something is helpful because it will bring you closer to doing meaningful activities and living your values in the long term.

A good place to start is to learn about different coping strategies and try them out.

# Primary title: In What Ways Do You Cope?
  ## Secondary title: Your ways of coping are unique to your situation
  ### Content: Chronic pain[2] can affect all parts of your life. There are different ways that you might cope[3] with pain in different situations. 

For example, when pain is getting in the way of your work day, you might take a break and go for a walk. Or, you might take some time off from work. When pain is keeping you up at night, you might listen to your favorite guided breathing meditation. Or, you might use medications to help you get to sleep. Some coping strategies might work better than others depending on your unique situation.

You know your pain best.

Some coping strategies for pain usually work well for most people, including practicing relaxation and staying active. These may work for you sometimes, and not other times. Your ways of coping might also be different from other people. 

You are the best person to evaluate the coping strategy that works best for you in any given situation. You are the best person to know if your coping strategy is adaptive[1] or maladaptive[5] in the long term. 

A useful way to think about coping strategies is to reflect on how they help you do the things that are meaningful[4] to you. For example, does taking time off work mean that you’ll be able to work more effectively when you go back instead of struggling to work through the pain? Does trying out a breathing meditation bring you closer to exploring the strength within your body? 
  
A good question to ask yourself is: Does a coping strategy help get you closer to one of your goals, no matter how small the goal is? Even taking the time to read this article is a small step towards doing something meaningful for yourself.

Coping strategies help you to regain your power over pain in different life situations. Only you can decide what feels truly helpful.

# Primary title: How to Evaluate Your Coping Strategies
  ## Secondary title: You’re the best person to evaluate what works for you
  ### Content: You probably have tried different ways of coping[2] with chronic pain[1]. Some things may have worked better than others. What’s the best way of deciding if a way of coping will be truly helpful for you?


Some ways of coping may work well in the moment. For example, resting in bed may help with pain during a bad flare-up. Other ways of coping may help to avoid pain in the long term. For example, pacing[4] your activities and not overdoing it may help avoid a bad flare-up. 

A helpful approach to evaluating a coping strategy is to think about how it gets you closer to what matters to you. 

What things and activities are meaningful[3] to you in your day-to-day life? It is time with family and friends, getting out in nature, working towards completing a project? It can be helpful to reflect on what brings meaning to your day when you’re faced with a decision of how to cope with pain. You can ask yourself these three questions:

1. Will this coping strategy bring relief in the short term?
2. Will this coping strategy solve the problem in the long term?
3. Will this coping strategy bring you closer to what matters to you?

In some situations, short-term relief may be really beneficial and can help you get through a difficult moment. In other situations, you may find that thinking about the long term can also help with pain and get you closer to your goals.

You are the one who knows best what coping strategy will bring you closer to what matters in your life. Even taking the time to evaluate ways of coping that can best get you there is a coping strategy in itself!

# Primary title: Coping with Alarm-Raising Thoughts About Pain
  ## Secondary title: How to turn worries about pain into more calming thoughts
  ### Content: Thoughts and beliefs can have a powerful influence on how pain feels. Having pain can make you think that something is seriously wrong with your body. But, these types of thoughts and worries can sometimes make pain worse.
 
Pain acts as the body’s alarm signal. It is meant to protect the body from harm. In chronic pain conditions, the alarm is raised when there is no danger. Thoughts and worries about the pain can often intensify the alarm or even trigger it.
 
So what can you do when you have frequent alarm-raising thoughts about pain?
 
Write down your most common anxious thoughts. For example: “My back is killing me again. There must be something seriously wrong with my spine.” Are any parts of this thought exaggerated or based on common misconceptions about pain?
 
Now see if you can turn the anxious thought into a more calming one. For example: “This back pain is really unpleasant now, but I know how to cope with it. The pain doesn’t mean that there is harm to my spine.” 
 
Keep a note of your calming thoughts handy for the next time when you need a reminder. 

With practice you will learn to turn off the alarm on anxious thoughts and worries to help you better cope with pain.

# Primary title: Your Flare-up Aid Kit
  ## Secondary title: Create an aid kit of coping strategies to reduce anxiety about a potential flare up
  ### Content: When you have chronic pain you may worry about your next flare-up. A flare-up is when your experience of pain increases because of a change in your health, stress level, physical activity, or environment.
 
Having a flare-up is normal and goes away with time. But sometimes it can leave you anxious about the next time a flare-up comes on. It’s helpful to have a plan for your next flare-up so that you can reduce constant anxiety about when the next flare-up will occur and what may happen. Let’s call it your flare-up aid kit.
 
What are some of the strategies that get you through a flare-up? 

It’s helpful to make a list of the things that worked well last time. Was a relaxation method or audio recording helpful? Did a heating pad or cold pack help with the pain? Did talking to a friend or a loved one help to make you feel better or distract you from how you were feeling? 

You can put the list in a special box along with the items that help you relax and soothe the pain. 

Your flare-up aid kit will give you the peace of mind that you’ll be ready to cope when the next flare-up comes on. More peace of mind and less worry may even stave off a flare-up. What would you put in your aid kit?

Many people have consistent triggers for flare-ups. By tracking your pain, you can learn when to expect a flare-up and how to manage to get through it or even avoid it altogether. 

Tracking can reduce your anxiety as you gain more control over your pain.
 
Flare-ups can be triggered by different aggravating factors, like changes in weather, stress, or activity levels. Each person with pain has their own unique aggravating factors.
 
Some factors, like the weather, are not easy to control. But, knowing that they are your triggers can help you to plan ahead to manage the flare-up. Other factors are easier to control. For example, for many people, stress can cause a flare-up. When you feel that your level of stress is increasing, you can focus on managing the stress so it doesn’t trigger a flare-up.
 
By paying attention to what happens around a flare-up and tracking it over time, you can reduce some of the anxiety of living with chronic pain. Reducing anxiety can also help to prevent flare-ups and improve daily functioning.

# Primary title: Managing Stress Helps with Pain
  ## Secondary title: Stress management is an effective strategy for coping with pain
  ### Content: Did you ever notice that you have more pain when you’re dealing with stress? For a lot of people, stress makes pain worse.  
 
Stress is a normal response of the body to things that are overwhelming or threatening. 

In the short-term, stress prepares the body to act and deal with threats. Threats can be physical, like a danger in the environment. They can also be emotional, like worry about not fulfilling commitments.
 
When stress happens on a regular basis, it can make your experience of pain worse. That’s why managing the things that cause regular stress in your life is an effective strategy for coping with pain.
 
What are some things that cause you a lot of stress? Not everything that’s stressful can be controlled. It helps to make a list of stressful things that you can and cannot control. Your list can help you see more clearly where you can make changes to reduce stress. 

It’s best to try and tackle one source of stress at a time. 

Are there any parts of your daily routine that can be simplified? Can you set some boundaries around what others expect of you? Can you set some limits around what you expect of yourself?
 
You can’t completely avoid stress in life, but strategies that help reduce stress can also help to reduce your experience of pain.

# Primary title: The Benefits of Pacing
  ## Secondary title: How pacing can help you regain control over your daily activities and feel better
  ### Content: When you live with pain, it can feel like pain is in control. On bad days, pain can prevent you from getting anything done. On good days, you try to catch up on everything and end up in more pain from overdoing it. This cycle can leave you feeling exhausted and powerless. 
 
But there is a strategy that can help you regain control over your daily activities. It’s called pacing.
 
Pacing involves planning and spacing out your daily activities with appropriate breaks. The goal is to conserve your energy levels on the good days and develop stamina for the bad days. Pacing allows you to be more consistent in how much you do in a day and prevents the “boom or bust” cycle.
 
Pacing is not just about taking breaks when you feel tired or when your symptoms start showing up or worsen. The idea is to schedule activities with regular breaks so that you rest before you feel like you need to. 

There is a good biological reason for pacing. When you overdo it, you may trigger a cascade of activation of nerve fibers that increases pain intensity. By keeping a steady level of activity, you prevent the over-activation of pain signals.
 
Pacing can be used to plan different types of activities, like movement and exercise, chores, hobbies, and social activities. 

On days when you have more pain, pacing can be especially helpful. By balancing a light activity with rest, you will maintain your stamina and prevent inactivity.

By planning and scheduling rest time into your activities, you will add more consistency to your day and regain control over what you can do. Which activity can you start with to try pacing?

  ### Defintions
Pacing: Pacing is a pain self-management strategy that involves planning and spacing time spent on activity and rest. Practicing pacing helps to improve daily functioning and engagement in meaningful activities.

“Boom or bust” cycle: The “boom or bust” cycle refers to a repetitive pattern of activity often seen in people living with pain. On good days they try to do too much (boom), followed by bad days when they feel unable to do anything (bust). 

Nerve fibers: Nerve fibers are the elongated parts of nerve cells that carry pain signals from one part of the body to another.

# Primary title: Activity Shifting
  ## Secondary title: Manage your energy level and get things done with this helpful strategy
  ### Content: Pain can get in the way of the things you want to do in your day. Chores and deadlines start to pile up, hobbies are left untouched, and social commitments are postponed. You start to feel like you’ll never be able to catch up because of pain.
 
Having pain can slow you down, but there are ways to get back to doing the things that you want to do. A helpful strategy is to pace the activities of the day and switch between different tasks to keep up your energy levels.
 
Let’s use household chores as an example.
 
You’re having a good day and you want to tidy up. But, you’re worried that spending all day doing chores will leave you exhausted and your pain will flare up. Rather than avoiding the task altogether, make a list of the most important things you want to get done. Now divide the list into hard, medium, and easy activities.
 
Depending on how you feel, you can start with the hard activity and do it for a short period of time. Even if you feel like you could keep going, take a rest and switch to an easier activity from one of the other categories. You can then switch back to the hard activity for another short period of time, then rest and switch to an easier one again.
 
Don’t plan to get everything done in one go. 

By keeping your energy levels up, you will avoid a pain flare up and build stamina so you can come back to the chores another day. Reward yourself with a satisfying break.

# Primary title: Scheduling Activities by Time of Day
  ## Secondary title: Use this strategy to take advantage of your daily rhythm
  ### Content: Are there certain times of day when your pain is usually better or worse?  For people living with pain, their symptoms often follow a daily rhythm. Some may feel best in the mornings and others may feel at their best in the afternoons or evenings.
 
Whatever your daily rhythm may be, you can use it as a starting point for planning your meaningful activities.
 
What time of day are you usually doing your best? You can start your plan by scheduling your hardest or most important activity during this time. It’s also a good idea to pace your activities by scheduling rest periods during your best time so that you can keep your energy levels up.
 
For the times of the day when your pain is usually worse, try not to plan activities that may be hard to do. Keeping these times mostly free of tasks will help to reduce any distress that you may feel if you are not able to get things done.
 
Organizing your activities according to your daily rhythm will help bring more consistency into your schedule. 

Developing a daily schedule can help you set manageable goals for your meaningful activities. To help you get started with this pacing strategy, try using the Manage My Pain app to track the daily rhythm of your symptoms for one week. 

If you’re not sure if your pain has a daily rhythm, you can monitor your pain and activities more closely several times a day, in the morning, noon, and evening for a week or so. This may reveal a pattern to your pain that you can use when scheduling your daily activities.

# Primary title: Setting Up for a Good Night’s Sleep
  ## Secondary title: How to make small adjustments to your bedroom to improve sleep
  ### Content: Pain and sleep are tied together quite closely. On the one hand, having pain can affect how well you sleep. On the other hand, sleep quality can affect your pain experience.
 
If you’re struggling with sleep problems, you can make small adjustments to your sleep environment to help you get a better night’s rest.
 
It helps to set up consistent bedtime cues to let your body know that it’s time to sleep. 

One way to do this is to use your bedroom and/or bed primarily for sleep. In your bedroom, you can arrange some of your favorite things that make you feel comfortable and calm. 

Try using some sensory cues like smells, sights, and sounds. You can light a candle, play some calming music, and dim the lights as you get ready for bed. Keep the space quiet, cool, and dark as you transition to sleep. You can try earplugs or background noise to reduce disruption from sounds.
 
Try to avoid screens in your bedroom, like your TV or smartphone, to reduce bedtime exposure to white and blue light that can interfere with sleep.

By setting up a consistent and comfortable sleep environment, you can help condition your body to more easily transition to sleep. 

To make sure that your body is ready for sleep, it’s important to avoid caffeine within 6 hours of bedtime, as well as large meals or exercise within 2 hours of bedtime.

# Primary title: Coping Thoughts to Help you Sleep
  ## Secondary title: How to calm your worries when you are struggling with sleep
  ### Content: Pain can affect how well you sleep. On top of having pain, you may worry about how missing sleep will affect your health and your ability to get through the day. 

But worries about missing sleep are often related to common misconceptions. 

You may worry that not getting 8 hours of sleep every night will seriously affect your health. But research shows that different people have different patterns of sleep and that your body will recover lost sleep over time.

You may worry that if you don’t sleep well, you won’t be able to function the next day. If this happens, think back to a time when you didn’t sleep well, but you were still able to get things done the next day.

When you find yourself worrying about sleep, try to think about or do something enjoyable. 

Think of a pleasant activity that you could do if you have trouble falling asleep or if you wake up at night. Maybe you could read, listen to your favorite music or audiobook, or make up a story in your mind. Soon your body will shift from worrying to a calmer state that will help you drift off to sleep more easily.

You can write down some of your own coping thoughts. These will come in handy when you find yourself worrying about sleep.

# Primary title: Relaxing to Sleep Routine
  ## Secondary title: How to prepare your body for a good night’s sleep
  ### Content: Pain can interfere with getting a good night’s sleep. Having pain can make you feel anxious and irritated and get in the way of falling asleep. This is a very normal response to having pain. The good news is that you can prepare your body for a good night’s sleep even if you have pain.
 
Let’s look at how you can work with your body’s nervous system to help you get into a sleepy state.
 
The nervous system regulates how active or calm you feel. One part of the nervous system, called the rest and digest system is involved in making you feel calm and safe. You can help to turn on this part of the nervous system by following some relaxation strategies before bed.
 
As you prepare for bed, set up a calming atmosphere by turning down the lights. You can sit in a comfortable position or lay down in your bed. Feel your body get heavy and let your muscles slowly relax. It helps to imagine your body melting into the floor or the bed.
 
Gently direct your attention to your breath. Breathe in deeply and feel the air passing through your nose or mouth. Feel your lungs expand with the air. Breathe out slowly focusing on the feeling of the air leaving your lungs. As you breathe out, try to make the exhale slightly longer than the inhale. Repeat this deep breathing relaxation technique a few times.
 
To relax even more deeply, focus on releasing tension from each part of your body one at a time. You can start by gently tensing the muscles in your feet and lower legs, then releasing the tension. Slowly repeat the same tensing and releasing in your upper legs, hips, torso, shoulders, arms, hands, neck, and head. Scan your body for any remaining tense spots. Focus on tensing and releasing the muscles in those areas again.
 
These relaxation techniques will help to shift your nervous system to a calm state so it’s ready for sleep.

# Primary title: Do You Have a Self-Management Plan for Pain?
  ## Secondary title: Find out how having a plan can help with pain
  ### Content: Chronic pain can take away from the things that you want to do in your daily life. It can limit your physical activity and disrupt your sleep. It can impact your relationships. It can affect your work or studies. It can derail your life goals. 

Pain may change how you live your life, but the good news is that you can do something to take charge of these changes. You can make a plan for how you manage and live with your pain. 

It’s called a self-management plan.

Managing your pain does not only mean visits to healthcare professionals to receive medical treatments. There are lots of day-to-day things that you can do yourself to help manage your pain. Things like your daily activities and responsibilities, how you deal with your symptoms and emotions, and who you reach out to for support are all part of a self-management plan to give you more control over your pain.

Research studies show that active self-management can improve pain, mental health, and quality of life.

A self-management plan can help you regain a sense of control over your pain. 

A good place to start with your plan is to learn more about your condition and your pattern of symptoms. Daily tracking of your pain and activities can help you notice patterns in how your pain changes and how you’re feeling.

Next, consider the things that make your symptoms better. For some people these will include relaxation, light physical activity, or reading a good book. You can make a plan to add the things that make your pain better to your daily routine. 

What meaningful activities would you like to do more of in your day? Maybe you’d like to connect with friends or loved ones, spend more time with a loved pet, curl up in bed with a good book or video? A plan can help you to set goals to add more meaningful activities to your day.

A self-management plan can set you on a path towards doing the things that help with pain and that matter in your life.

  ## Secondary title: It’s the small things in life that can be most meaningful.
  ### Content: What comes to mind when you think of a meaningful activity? When you’re living with pain, this question can be quite intimidating. You may think of big life events and accomplishments that seem out of reach because of your pain.

But often it’s the little day-to-day things that add meaning to life. 

A phone call. A short walk outside. Tidying up a desk or a cabinet. Doing some art or spending a bit of time on a hobby. Have any of these things ever made you feel good?

Engaging in meaningful activities doesn’t mean doing all the things you would do if you didn’t have pain. Many activities that are within your reach right now can bring a lot of meaning and pleasure.

Here are some meaningful activities that you may find can help make life more worthwhile:

* Connecting with people who you care about. It can be as simple as sending a text or two, chatting on the phone, or sharing a meal.
* Having fun with hobbies and games. You could try reading, playing with a pet, handicrafts, art, or doing a puzzle. What are some fun things that you like to do?
* Doing chores or running errands. Even though they are not fun to do, crossing them off the list can be very satisfying!
* Taking care of your health. Doing a little gentle physical exercise or cooking a meal can go a long way towards adding some healthy habits to your day.
* Taking care of yourself. On some days even having a warm shower or a bath can feel like a big win towards self-care!

As the saying goes, it’s the little things in life that mean the most. There are lots of little things that you can do each day to add meaning to your life. Use Manage My Pain to help you keep track of the daily activities that are meaningful to you.

# Primary title: Living Your Values
  ## Secondary title: Identify your values to help you focus on doing the things that matter to you
  ### Content: Pain makes it difficult to do all the things that you would like to do. On a typical day you may only be able to do some of those things, or even none. When you’re only able to do a few things, it may be helpful to reflect on your values to identify the meaningful activities[1] that you want to focus on.

Values[2] are not goals; they are more like principles that can give your life direction. Some examples of meaningful values include connecting with people (for example with family, friends, or community), creativity, productivity (at work or at home), self-development, spirituality, etc. 

Take a moment to think of one or two values that are meaningful to you. 

Now think back to your Daily Reflection in the App. Are there any activities that you did that were meaningful to you? Did these activities relate to any of your values? 

For example, if you picked the value of connecting with people, a meaningful activity might be sending a text to a friend or sending an overdue reply to a message. If you picked productivity, a meaningful activity might be tidying up a cupboard or drawer. 

Completing small activities that reflect your values can bring a sense of satisfaction to your day and improve how you’re feeling. 

You can log your meaningful activities in the Daily Reflection to help keep track of how you’re living your values.

# Primary title: Coping through Self-Compassion
  ## Secondary title: Treating yourself with kindness and care when you need it most
  ### Content: Many people who have pain find it hard to feel good about themselves. They may feel disappointed in themselves for not being able to do things. Or they may feel angry and frustrated with themselves and with those around them, which makes them also feel guilty and ashamed. 

A lot of negative feelings about yourself often come up when you have chronic pain.

One way to cope with these negative feelings is through self-compassion. Self-compassion is the practice of being kind and understanding to yourself when you face difficulties, feel inadequate, or experience suffering.

The goal of self-compassion is not to get rid of negative or painful feelings. Self-compassion involves gently accepting that the feelings are painful and offering kind support and care to yourself.

Try this exercise as a way to practice self-compassion. Imagine how you would help a dear friend if they were facing a difficult time. How would you talk to them? How would you show them that you care and understand their struggles? Now pretend that the dear friend is you. Try to gently direct those same words and that same care and understanding to yourself.

When you are experiencing pain and negative emotions, it’s sometimes hard to be good to yourself without feeling bad about it. Self-compassion takes some practice, but it’s a proven coping strategy to help you move through difficult times.

# Primary title: Work Towards Your Goals the SMART Way
  ## Secondary title: Set an action plan for your goals that fits your life right now
  ### Content: Setting goals and working towards them is hard on the best days. When you have chronic pain, even simple goals can seem impossible to achieve. 

The good news is that there are ways that you can make goals achievable by breaking them down in a SMART way.

SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Bound. Organizing your goals the SMART way is a proven strategy for success, even in difficult circumstances.

Let’s pick a goal and look at each of the SMART steps. 

Say you want to incorporate a gentle stretching practice into your day. As you make a SMART plan to achieve this goal, below are some questions that you might think about. Writing down the answers will help you visualize your progress towards the goal.

Specific: What will you do specifically? When will you do it? Where will you do it? How are you going to do it?

Here are some examples of possible answers: Do gentle stretches prescribed by your physical therapist. Do them when you wake up each morning in your bedroom. Put on some quiet music and follow the stretches on the worksheet from your therapist. 

Measurable: How will you measure your progress?

Set a timer and start with 1 minute each day on Week 1, 2 minutes each day on Week 2, 3 minutes each day on Week 3, etc., until I get to 10 minutes on Week 10.

Attainable: How confident are you that you can accomplish this goal? How important is the goal to you?

You can answer these questions on a scale of 0-10 to gauge how you feel about this goal and why you want to achieve it. 

Realistic: What are the first actions that you will take to achieve this goal? How will you deal with challenges that get in the way?

My first actions are going to be finding music that I like to get me motivated to start. My second action will be to put the stretching worksheet in the bedroom. My third action will be to print a 10-week calendar where I can check off when I did the stretches.

One challenge that I foresee is that I’m in too much pain to move in the morning. If this is the case, I will do my stretches at lunch or in the evening or when I feel better.

Time-Bound: When will you start working towards this goal?

I will start on this date______ and work towards the goal for 10 weeks.

Give the SMART way a try with one of your own goals. You’ll be surprised what you can achieve if you make a SMART action plan.

# Primary title: How Can Breathing Help with Pain?
  ## Secondary title: Breathing is a powerful tool for managing pain
  ### Content: Have you ever noticed how the intensity of your pain affects how you breathe?

Clinical studies show that there is a close relationship between having pain and the pattern of breathing. When pain feels very intense, for example after an injury, people will often gasp and hold their breath. When intense pain persists for a long time, breathing often becomes very quick and shallow, and people might even hyperventilate.

 A change in the pattern of breathing is a common response to pain.

There is also another side to the relationship between pain and breathing. Changing how you breathe can reduce pain! For centuries, people have known that certain breathing techniques can be helpful in times of anxiety, distress, and even pain. This is why breathing techniques are such a popular method used to help manage pain for women in labour. 

Recent clinical studies have confirmed that slowing down the pace of breathing can reduce the intensity of pain. Slow deep breaths are commonly prescribed to patients to help control pain. When pain makes you want to hold your breath or hyperventilate, you can help control it by doing the opposite and breathing slowly and more deeply.

The benefit of breathing as a way to help manage pain is that it is easy to learn. 

Breathing is something the body is doing already. With a bit of guidance and practice, you can train your body to breathe in ways that help with your pain.

# Primary title: The Breathing Method for Pain
  ## Secondary title: This pattern of breathing can help with managing your pain
  ### Content: Slow deep breathing[1] is the most effective pattern of breathing for pain. 

Clinical studies show that slowing down breathing to around 6 breaths per minute is effective in reducing the intensity of pain. 

A slow, deep breathing pattern helps with pain in several ways. It helps to slow your heart rate and makes you feel more calm and relaxed. It also distracts from other sensations in your body. It’s an effective way to gently regain control of how your body feels.

Slowing your breathing down to 6 breaths per minute is a proven way to calm down your nervous system.  A good way to do this is to inhale for around 4 seconds and exhale for around 6 seconds.

Here is how you can do try this breathing pattern on your own:

- Sit in a position that is comfortable for you. 
- Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly, if that feels ok.
- Inhale slowly through your nose.
- As you inhale, count 4 seconds. 
- (Try saying this in your head to help you count: 1-potato, 2-potato, 3-potato, 4-potato)
- Exhale slowly through your nose or mouth.
- As you exhale, count 6 seconds.
- Continue breathing: in for 4 seconds and out for 6 seconds.
- Keep breathing like this for 2 to 3 minutes.
- Notice how your body is feeling and continue for a few more minutes if that feels comfortable.

# Primary title: The Modern Approach to Pain Treatment
  ## Secondary title: Considering pain from a holistic perspective
  ### Content: There are many treatment options for chronic pain. They range widely, from taking medications and undergoing medical procedures to physical therapy and psychological treatments. When you live with pain, it can be confusing to choose the treatment approach that’s right for you.

Why are there so many available treatments? It’s because chronic pain is not a simple condition. 

Many factors contribute to pain. Most people accept that pain is the result of what is happening in the body. Yet, pain is also influenced by your mood and thoughts, your social environment, and your lifestyle.

The modern approach to pain treatment is based on a holistic model, called the Biopsychosocial Model of Pain. This model takes into account the many factors that interact to produce the experience of pain. Each person’s pain experience is unique and reflects what their life is like.

A holistic strategy for pain treatment targets the three M’s: medicine, mind, and movement. 

Studies show that the best way to address pain is through this multi-pronged strategy. This strategy can involve medication and medical interventions for pain. It also takes into account issues of the mind, like anxiety, depression, and learning pain coping skills. Lastly, it encourages movement to keep up endurance and help with pain.  

When considering your own treatment approach for chronic pain, keep in mind that a combination of treatments often works best.

# Primary title: Why See a Psychologist for Pain?
  ## Secondary title: Pain is real and psychological treatment can help you gain control over it.
  ### Content: People usually consider pain to be a problem of the body. Many are puzzled, afraid, or even angry when a doctor recommends seeing a psychologist for pain. Is the doctor suggesting that the pain is “all in their head”?

The pain that you feel is very much real. Period. 

Pain is not only based on signals that come from the body. Your thoughts and worries, your emotions and past experiences, your relationships, and your environment all play a role in your pain. These experiences combine together in the brain. 

The brain is ultimately the part of the body that produces the feeling of pain. That’s why psychological treatment is helpful for pain.

Seeing a psychologist can help to address pain by considering the bigger picture of your life. 

A psychologist can help you examine how pain impacts your life. They can help you to evaluate your expectations, thoughts, and feelings related to pain. They can help you to find ways to cope with the challenges of living with pain and take back control.

Research shows that seeing a psychologist can help people learn to move pain into the background and get back to living their life.

  ## Secondary title: Taking an active approach to your pain treatment can increase its effectiveness
  ### Content: Chronic pain can make you feel like there is nothing you can do to make things better. People often put all their hope in doctors to fix their pain. But did you know that the treatments your doctor prescribes can be even more effective if you take an active role in your medical care?

Research studies show that patients who are more engaged in their medical care have better outcomes.

How can you become an active partner in your pain treatments? The first step is learning more about chronic pain. You can ask your doctor (or other healthcare providers) for resources to learn about your specific condition. 

Learning more about pain can improve how you communicate with your doctor and other healthcare providers. Take the time to discuss your condition and treatment options. If you’re unsure about something, it’s ok to ask questions.

# Primary title: Meet Mariana: Learning to Cope with Chronic Pain
  ## Secondary title: Mariana manages her chronic pain by focusing on self-care
  ### Content: After doing a simple everyday chore, Mariana hurt her back and has had chronic pain ever since. Her positive approach to taking care of herself has helped her overcome some of the challenges of chronic pain.

For many years Mariana led a sedentary lifestyle working as a software developer. She focused a lot on others and much less on herself. When lifting a basket of laundry one day, she herniated two lumbar discs leading to lingering chronic pain. The pain made it difficult for her to do everyday tasks and continued to get worse. She also started feeling different pain characteristics like numbness, tingling, needling, and stabbing.
 
Mariana developed sleep problems and anxiety about increasing pain. She faced financial challenges in paying for her treatments. She found that doctors often didn’t take her pain seriously and she sometimes felt humiliated after asking for pain medication. Although Mariana’s friends and colleagues have been supportive, she often feels like her injury defines her identity. She has struggled to juggle her professional life, travel, and housework with her chronic pain.
 
“I cannot count anymore how many days I felt guilt for missing an important meeting or for not going outside on a summer day,” recounts Mariana.
 
Manage My Pain has helped Mariana to track her symptoms and her daily activities. Thanks to tracking, she finds that she’s more aware of small improvements from day to day. She can also better see how her level of pain is affected by her activities. And she uses the data from MMP Charts to better communicate with her doctors about her pain.
 
Mariana has yet to find an ideal pain medication that works for her. To cope with her pain, she tries to maintain a positive attitude and focuses on self-care. She practices different pain management methods like meditation and keeping physically active. Mariana is also careful about her sleep cycle and food intake. Learning how to care for herself has made a big difference in how she now lives with her chronic pain. 
 
“In my journey with chronic pain, I have learned that nobody will cope with my pain if I do not cope with my pain myself,” reflects Mariana.

# Primary title: Meet Richard: Taking Control of his Chronic Pain
  ## Secondary title: Richard continues doing the activities he loves by adapting to the limitations of his body
  ### Content: Richard is an outdoor enthusiast from New Zealand who lives an active life. He participates in various outdoor pursuits and multi-sport events. He has also volunteered on fire fighting and search and rescue teams. Physical activity and being outdoors are not just his passion but also a big part of managing his bipolar and anxiety disorders.

Due to injuries that occurred during his outdoor pursuits, Richard has been living with pain since his late teens. Repeated strains and sprains followed by a couple of serious injuries to his knee and ankle have led to ongoing problems with pain. Richard was recently diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)[1] in the lower leg.

Richard has found a lot of support for his condition through the primary health care system and accident insurance in New Zealand. But, he has had trouble accessing specialized pain clinics. He was also disappointed not to qualify for a knee replacement due to his young age. 

While continuing to stay active, Richard manages his pain by using strapping[3] methods and sports bands. He takes pain medication and participates in regular physical therapy[2]. He also uses a TENS[4] machine to reduce muscle tension and pain. 

Richard uses Manage My Pain to help him understand the aggravating and alleviating factors for his pain. 

“Manage My Pain lets me know if I am overdoing things, as I am still regularly active” reflects Richard. 

The app also helps him to keep track of which non-medical interventions work best for different aspects of his pain. The reports from the app have also been helpful to Richard’s doctor and support worker. They give them more insights into Richard’s condition and pain management efforts. 

“Do not let your pain rule or control you. You are in charge of your own pain”, advises Richard.

For Richard, part of the challenge of living with chronic pain has been in trying to be strong and stoic. He has learned to listen to his pain and work within its limitations. He has found that he doesn’t have to give up what he loves but instead adapt his activities in an appropriate manner.

# Primary title: Meet Janice: From Shoulder Injury to Cockatoo Savior
  ## Secondary title: Janice is moving forward after dealing with chronic pain for years
  ### Content: Janice is focusing on moving forward after a very challenging journey with chronic pain. Her journey started with a lifting injury to her shoulder when she was in her late 20s. She received treatment for the injury, but the pain in her shoulder got worse year by year. Eventually, Janice was diagnosed with fibromyalgia[1]. 

The treatments Janice received for her pain only provided temporary relief. She also developed other conditions, including sleep problems, migraines[2], and irritable bowel syndrome[3]. To keep working in her job as a nurse, she switched to work with infants instead of adults. But Janice continued to struggle with her pain. Her social life and marriage began to fall apart. She had to switch to a desk job to accommodate her body. 

Janice became distressed and felt like she was getting nowhere. Her visits with doctors added to her mental anguish. They mostly dismissed her pain and didn’t offer anything beyond the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Janice lived this way for years. She saw therapists and had some surgeries until she was no longer able to work. The pain kept flaring up. She reached the point of breakdown and felt that she could not go on living. 

During her struggle with pain, Janice kept a hand-written journal to track her symptoms. Then she found Manage My Pain, which simplified her life. She was able to log all the relevant information and quickly find it when she needed it. She was able to prepare for every doctor’s appointment by reviewing her charts and pain records. She felt like everything was organized and up to date. 

“With this app, I never lose sight of what is happening with my body, and it gives me the confidence to have the answers to any doctors' questions”, notes Janice. 

Over time, Janice regained her strength, and started to see and feel improvement. She had an arthroscopic procedure and was prescribed appropriate pain medication, which helped her manage her pain. She also won her disability case, which helped her regain her confidence in herself.

Today, Janice focuses on the things that she can do rather than lamenting the past. She now lives with 4 parrots that keep her going and bring her joy. She manages her pain with medication and moderate exercise. She enjoys the good days and gives herself latitude to do nothing on the worst days without feeling guilt about being unproductive. 

“You can get your life back. It will be a different one than before the pain but life is full of surprises so don't ever give up” reflects Janice.

  ## Secondary title: Karen is learning to advocate for herself when dealing with a rare condition
  ### Content: An infection caused by a fish resulted in a life of agonizing pain for Karen.
 
A self-professed workaholic, Karen owns and operates a Real Estate Brokerage Firm. She contracted a terrible infection while cleaning a fish tank and acquired a rare disease called aquarium granuloma. She lives with flu-like symptoms on most days.
 
Since acquiring the infection, Karen has attributed her pain symptoms to the disease. But after seeing several doctors, she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia[1]. She also suffers from Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, and Hypertension.
 
Karen finds it challenging to get the care she needs with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. She feels that doctors often dismiss her concerns and symptoms. She’s frustrated when she feels like she can’t explain herself well enough for people to understand what she’s going through. She has also struggled to have her disability claim approved. 

“I can't explain myself well enough to help people understand, and that's frustrating,” reflects Karen.
 
Since finding the Manage My Pain app, Karen has had an easier time advocating for herself during doctors’ appointments. She finds that she can make better sense of her symptoms. Her reports help her and her doctors form plans for her treatments. She even used them at her disability hearing.

Karen has learned that it’s important to take care of yourself even if you don’t have all the answers right away. She finds that Manage My Pain has simplified things for her so it’s not so overwhelming to deal with her condition. 

“After all that's the point, to make life easier,” notes Karen.
 
Currently, Karen manages her pain with different pain medications. She also watches what she eats and rests when she needs to. She avoids tasks that she doesn’t have the energy for and works to decrease the stress in her life.
