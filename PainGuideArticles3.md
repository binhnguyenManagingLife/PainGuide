  ## Secondary title: Anxiety Before Surgery: How to Manage
  ### Content: Surgery – or “going under the knife” – can be very frightening. Anxiety before surgery is perfectly normal and to be expected. Whether you have months or just days to prepare, you may feel overwhelmed, nervous, fearful and uncertain. You may even want to back out of it completely! You are not alone. These feelings are common and understandable.

Fortunately, there are some strategies to help you cope and feel less anxious. Your anxiety about surgery is manageable.

Prepare ahead.

Planning ahead can give you a sense of control. You’ve given a lot of thought to your surgery and your recovery. Now, you want to be physically, mentally and practically prepared.

Speak up. Speak to your surgeon, nurse or medical team about your concerns. Create a list of questions, especially if there are aspects you are uncertain of. They receive these types of concerns all the time, so there are no dumb questions.

Knowledge is power. Educate yourself about the procedure and the recovery. This will help manage your expectations and make you feel prepared.

Practical strategies.

Practice breathing. When we are anxious, we sometimes forget to breathe properly. We become tense. Taking deep, focused breaths can alleviate this tension and help calm our bodies and mind. And it can be done anytime, anywhere. Practice ahead of time: 

• Sit in a position that is comfortable for you. 
• Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly, if that feels ok.
• Inhale slowly through your nose.
• As you inhale, count 4 seconds. 
• (Try saying this in your head to help you count: 1-potato, 2-potato, 3-potato, 4-potato)
• Exhale slowly through your nose or mouth.
• As you exhale, count 6 seconds.
• Continue breathing: in for 4 seconds and out for 6 seconds.
• Keep breathing like this for 2 to 3 minutes.
• Notice how your body is feeling and continue for a few more minutes if that feels comfortable.  

Plan for recovery. Get things done around the home or at work ahead of time. Plan for the basics like meals, bathing, sleeping arrangements and appointment transportation. If possible, coordinate help in advance.

Think about your future. What things in your life are important to you? How will having this surgery possibly allow for more of these things? Picturing the end goal can be helpful for getting through the momentary tough anxiety.

  ### Content: What is surgical anxiety?

Feeling anxious or fearful before surgery is very common. Different patients fear different things. It is important to think about what you are afraid of. Then try to think about where this fear comes from. The more you understand what you are anxious about, the better you can prepare. Some common anxieties are:

• Fear of hospitals
• Death
• Pain
• Recovery and results
• Life after surgery
• Surgical mistakes
• Fear of anaesthesia
• Fear of the unknown 

Once you identify your main fears, you can prepare yourself ahead of time. You should also talk to your medical team and support system about your fears, so they can also help you cope.


What does anxiety feel like?

Even though surgical anxiety is very common, the symptoms can be unpleasant. And unfortunately, the distress they cause, can make you feel even more fearful! That is why it is important to label them as anxiety, because anxiety can be controlled. Some common anxiety symptoms include:

• Increase in heart rate
• Sweating
• “Butterflies” in your stomach
• Nausea
• Sleep difficulties
• Racing thoughts 

Remember – these feelings are normal and will not last forever!

Does anxiety impact my surgery and recovery?

As you can see above, anxiety has many physical and psychological effects. Many people experience both types of symptoms.

Physically, anxiety can cause tightened muscles, headaches, nausea and many more symptoms. These symptoms can make your surgical recovery more challenging.

Psychologically, anxiety can disrupt sleep, cause you to overthink, and contribute to low mood and irritability. Before and after your surgery, you will want to feel rested and prepared.

Managing these anxiety symptoms can help you focus on your recovery.
